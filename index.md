# Welcome to Alanah's dissertation

Here's a little website on what I'm doing for my philosophy dissertation.

## My Title

How the use of AI in Commercial Platforms Increases Power Imbalances, and what to do about it!

### Philosophical themes my essay will explore
1. **Epistemology** - How AI and machine learning algorithms enable the exploitation of Big Data to create new ways of knowing about ourselves
2. **Ethics** - How privacy and explainability issues resulting from these techniques create distinct ethical issues

### Socio-political themes my essay will explore
3. **Power** - How these ethical issues translate into power imbalances between commercial enterprises and consumers
4. **Regulation** - How the state can regulate these technological tools to address 2 and 3

One source I'll be using is the Financial Times' Special Report on AI ethics: [https://www.ft.com/reports/big-tech-ethics], as well as Oxford's Professor Luciano Floridi's work into AI ethics (_thank you Julio for recommending him to me, he's great_).
